Issue: For some reason it keeps choosing counter_last for Quincy
Reason: Only last used strategy is updated in the rewards dictionary
Solution: Keep tracking rewards for all strategies simultaneously
          To do this, I need to track guesses of all strategies for
          the previous rounds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue: Even though a cycle is found, the prediction is wrong
Reason: It uses the same strategy continuously because the reward of that particular
        strategy is maximized after many games
Solution: Reset the strategy rewards when the win rate is too high or rewards go too high
